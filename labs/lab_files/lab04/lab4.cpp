 * This program displays a menu and asks the user to make a selection:
 * (Use the if/else-if/else statement to determine which item the user chooses.)
 *
 * The menu is outlined below:
 *  
 * Geometry Calculator
 *    
 *     1.  Calculate the Area of a Circle   
 *     2.  Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
 *     3.  Calculate the Area of a Triangle
 *     4.  Quit
 *
 *     Enter your choice (1 - 4)
 *
 *
 *
 * If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle     
 * and then display its area. Write the calclated area to a  
 * file named GeoCalculator.txt (e.g. The Area of the Circle is: )
 * Use the following formula: 
 *  	   
 * area = pi * r * r 
 *   
 * Use 3.14159 for pi, and the radius of the circle for r.
 *
 *
 *
 * If the user enters 2, the program should ask for the length and width 
 * of the rectangle and then display the rectangle's area. Write the calclated 
 * area in a sentence form to a file named GeoCalculator.txt 
 * (e.g. The Area of the rectangle is: ) Use the following formula: 
 * 
 * area = length * width
 * 
 *
 *
 * If the user enters 3, the program should ask for the length of the triangle's
 * base and height, and then display its area. Write the calclated area
 * to a file named GeoCalculator.txt (e.g. The Area of the Triangle is: )          
 * Use the following formula:
 * 
 * area = base * height * 0.5
