 * This program calculates compensation for a sales person.
 * The compensation scheme is outlined below:
 *
 *    If the seller has sold 10 or fewer units:
 *        he receives the flat pay rate of $75.00
 *
 *    If the seller has sold 11-50 units:
 *        he receives the base rate of $12.50 per unit sold
 *
 *    If the seller has sold 51-100 units:
 *        he receives bonus rate of 13.50 per unit sold
 *
 *    If the seller has sold more than 100 units:
 *        he receives the bonus rate of 13.50 per unit sold 
 *        plus a century seller bonus of $1000.00
 *
 * The user will be prompted for 
 *    his or her firstname and Lastname
 *    how many units they have sold 
 * via the console.  
 * The user's response is also to be read from the console.
 *
 * input: Last Name (a string, read from the the console)
 *        First Name (a string, read from the the console)
 *        units sold (an integer, read from the console)
 *
 * constants: int FLAT_PAY = 75 
 *            double BASE_RATE = 12.50
 *            double BONUS_RATE = 13.50
 *            int CENTURY_BONUS = 1000
 *
 *
 * output: The amount the salesperson should be paid for this pay
 *         period.  The amount should always show fixed point notation
 *         and should always show 2 digits to the right of the decimal
 *         point. (write to the screen and to a file named compensation.txt)
